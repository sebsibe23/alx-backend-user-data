# Project Title: PII Obfuscation and Password Encryption

## Overview

This project aims to develop a secure Python application that demonstrates the implementation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) obfuscation and password encryption techniques. By following the outlined requirements and learning objectives, developers will gain proficiency in handling sensitive data securely within their applications.

## Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** May 29, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** May 31, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** May 29, 2024, 6:00 PM
- **Manual QA Review:** To be requested upon project completion
- **Auto Review:** Scheduled for the deadline

## Resources

### Reading/Watching Materials:

- [What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?](https://example.com/pii-article)
- [Logging Documentation](https://example.com/logging-docs)
- [Bcrypt Package Documentation](https://example.com/bcrypt-docs)
- [Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting](https://example.com/logging-formatting)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to articulate the following concepts without external assistance:

- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Implementation of a log filter for PII obfuscation
- Password encryption using bcrypt
- Authentication to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

### Environment:

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python 3.7

### Coding Standards:

- All files must end with a newline character.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.5) for code styling.
- All files must be executable.
- Module, class, and function documentation is mandatory.
- Functions should be type annotated.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.7 and required packages are installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

### Execution

- Run the main script: `python3 main.py`
- Follow on-screen instructions.
