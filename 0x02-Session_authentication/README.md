# 0x02. Session Authentication

## Overview

This project involves implementing a Session Authentication system from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism. The project aims to teach the core concepts and practical implementation of session authentication in a web application. 

**Project Timeline:**
- **Start:** June 5, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End:** June 7, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** June 5, 2024, 6:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** At the deadline

## Background Context

In a professional setting, it is recommended to use established modules or frameworks for session authentication (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth for Python-Flask). However, this project requires implementing the session authentication mechanism from scratch for educational purposes. This hands-on approach will help in understanding the fundamental steps involved in session authentication.

## Resources

To complete this project, you should refer to the following resources:

- **REST API Authentication Mechanisms** (Focus on the session auth part)
- **HTTP Cookie**
- **Flask Documentation**
- **Flask Cookie Documentation**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Explain what authentication means.
2. Describe what session authentication means.
3. Understand what Cookies are.
4. Know how to send Cookies.
5. Parse Cookies effectively.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All classes should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should not be a single word but a comprehensive sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure Python 3.7 and necessary tools are installed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

2. **Understanding Authentication:**
   - Study the basics of authentication and session management.
   - Read about HTTP Cookies and their role in session management.

3. **Implementing Session Authentication:**
   - Create a simple web application using Flask.
   - Implement session authentication without using external libraries.
   - Handle sending and parsing of Cookies.

4. **Documentation and Styling:**
   - Write comprehensive documentation for each module, class, and function.
   - Ensure code follows the `pycodestyle` style guide.
   - Make sure all scripts are executable and end with a new line.

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the length of files using `wc`.
   - Verify documentation using the specified Python commands.

By following these steps, you will gain a thorough understanding of session authentication and be able to implement it effectively in a web application.

## Conclusion

This project is a valuable learning experience that emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanics of session authentication. By building the system from scratch, you will develop a strong foundation in web security practices and session management.
